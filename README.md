# lum.build.js

An internal development package for other `@lumjs` packages to use.
Not meant for use outside that scope.

Currently has a script for building some meta-docs that can be included with
the documentation generated by jsdocs, as well as a jsdoc configuration 
builder with a bunch of my own default rules.

As I'm planning to support ES modules and possibly Typescript in the future,
this will be the package that gets the build tools for doing any transpiling.
